# is-twentyeight

Objectively, the number 28 is the best number on the planet. We can all agree on that, right? (Anyone who disagrees may submit an essay explaining why 28 is not the best number in the issues section of this repository). This blessed number, therefore, deserves its own package.
  
Usage:
```
import { isTwentyEight } from "is-twentyeight";

console.log(isTwentyEight(28)); // the best number ever
console.log(isTwentyEight(27)); // ugly number
```
